This website has been made with **React**.

This is a project for a Swedish company that offers kitchen management and commercial kitchen architect consulting worldwide.

Since they offer a top class service, I decided to design a flawless layout with smooth transitions.

I used white, brown and gold as colour palette to suggest luxury and reliability.

I used **SCSS** as a CSS preprocessor as there are re-usable components and I wanted the structure to be as clear as possible.

To make the website responsive, I used **react-responsive**.
